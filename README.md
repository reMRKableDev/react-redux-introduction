# react-redux-introduction

An introduction to using Redux on a React application.
This covers the basics of Redux strict unidirectional data flow.

## Getting Started

Remember that Redux is only a tool that is used to manage an application's state!
It isn't a compulsary tool to your React applications.
Consider the data flow of your app before using Redux.

The 3 fundamental principles of Redux:

```
1. Single Source of Truth - the state of an application is stored in an object tree within a single store.
2. State is Read-Only - the only way to change the state is to emit an action.
3. Changes Are Made With Pure Functions - reducers specify how the state is transformed by actions
```

That's pretty much it!

There aren't any big configurations needed here just be sure to run the latest versions of all the named dependencies.
